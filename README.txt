I basically completed this snake game using  Python's turtle module. Initially, I considered it just one of my exercises to apply all the knowledge from this module 
that I have learned, but then it sparked a lot of interest. It's exciting to realize that making games is just as enjoyable as playing them. Above are all my thoughts
and feelings. I hope you give this game a shot and offer me any comments or suggestion if you have any.
